**ReconRover** is a comprehensive subdomain and vulnerability scanner designed to automate the process of discovering and assessing security vulnerabilities and enumerating applications across a domain(s). It integrates powerful tools like `subfinder`, `nuclei`, `httpx`, and `katana` to deliver an extensive security analysis.

## **Features**

- **Subdomain Enumeration**: Uses `subfinder` to discover subdomains for the target domain.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Employs `nuclei` to identify CVEs and vulnerabilities.
- **HTTP Probing**: Utilizes `httpx` to gather information about HTTP services and their configurations.
- **Link Discovery**: Leverages `katana` to find and catalog links, including `.js`, `.php`, and other interesting files.
- **Detailed Results**: Outputs results in a structured format for easy analysis.
